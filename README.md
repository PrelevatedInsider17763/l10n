Issue tracker for the Windows 10 &amp; 11 Community Language Pack project.

## What is this project about?

We've noticed that there's been a noticable drop in quality of the localized versions of Windows, and we want to do something about it. This repository has two purposes: 

-   It's a pool of feedback that Microsoft can be pointed at to make it clear internally that this is a problem that needs to be addressed
-   It will be used to make **custom language packs** to fix the issues reported here on our own!

## Why is this happening?

We're not entirely sure. Microsoft does ostensibly have a dedicated localization team, however they seem to have relegated the work to people that do not speak the respective languages and use automated translation tools instead. This has resulted in a noticable drop in quality for every part of Windows that they touch, going as far as having inconsistent localizations for the branding of apps and hero features, which is bad.

## How can I help?

Getting started is easy! Just boot up Windows 11 on your PC or in a VM, and start looking for bad localizations. Things like the Settings app and other areas that were modernized with Windows 11 are great candidates for finding a lot of suboptimal or outright wrong translations. Unfortunately, no area of Windows is above scrutiny since Microsoft seems to have started tampering with old strings that used to be properly translated as well. 

These issues fall roughly into three categories:

-   **Localizations that are outright wrong and incongruent** (E.g. using the wrong translation for an ambiguous word)
-   **Localizations that are not wrong, but use uncommon or confusing phrasing**
-   **Localizations for things that should use not be translated** (Brand names, loanwords)

If you find something, go to the *Issues* page in this repository and check if the issue you've found has already been reported. If not, feel free to create a *New Issue*! The template will guide you through the process. You can also look through the existing issues and provide feedback if you have a suggestion for any of them.
